# RU Direct

## Description
RU Direct is an Android app that provides a clean and easy to use interface for finding out which Rutgers buses are active, what places they stop at, and when they will be arriving at each of the stops. RU Direct's responsiveness and intuitive design dramatically improves the experience of using Rutgers' bus system, making it the ideal replacement for the current Rutgers University bus app.

## Things to Do
- Update app icon
- Add in caching of the bus times and put a notification of when the times were last updated
- Add directions from one bus stop to another
- Add About page with contributors and Google Maps attribution
- Publish the app on the Play Store and release it to the public

## Contributors
RU Direct is currently in active development by Richard Chu, James Paik, Kenny Li, and Andy Le.
