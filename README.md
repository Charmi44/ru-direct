# RU Direct

## Description
RU Direct is an Android app that provides a clean and easy to use interface for finding out which Rutgers buses are active, what places they stop at, and when they will be arriving at each of the stops. This app is a replacement for the current Rutgers University bus app, which is too slow and clunky for everyday use. RU Direct's responsiveness and intuitive design should dramatically improve the experience of using Rutgers' bus system.

## Things to Do
- Add expanded times (in 12:00 form) when bus stop is clicked on
- Make the app look better (It's getting there)
- Publish the app on the Play Store and release it to the public
- Add in maps of the bus routes
- Add directions from one bus stop to another
- iOS version
